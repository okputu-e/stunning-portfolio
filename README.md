# Stunning_portfolio

    This is my portfolio which includes all projects I have created.

## Technologies used

    It will be a simple portfolio and the following
    technologies are used:
    -Html
    -Css
    -Sass
    -Javascript

### Workflow

    Every feature, bug or modification will have a branch
    
    main
     - branch for production only
    develop 
     - branch for development and merges

    It might be a simple project but I believe it is always
    good to practice what i was taught. This workflow was taught
    to be by wejapa internship by Mr Biase.
